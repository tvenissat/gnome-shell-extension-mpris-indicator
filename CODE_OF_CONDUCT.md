# Community Conduct Guidlines
Much like a good many other opensource projects this is not a democracy. At best it's a meritocracy, at worst it's a dictatorship. You are free to fork it and go your own way at any point, for any reason you choose.

Oher than that basically just be cool. If you're cool I'll be cool and we're all cool. Cool? Do we really need any other rules?

JasonLG1979 reserves the right, at his whim to decide what "cool" means at any particular moment. But as a guideline "cool" is generally defined as being kind and respectful to others.
